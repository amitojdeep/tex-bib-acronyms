# tex-bib-acronyms
I had issues with making first names as acronyms while using Elseveir latex template as natbib was not compatible with biblatex and I had to do my work on Overleaf.
So I made this nifty notebook for myself and others!
Supports:
Middle names,
Already truncated names,
Special characters.

Feel free to debug it yourself, I take no support gaurantees!
